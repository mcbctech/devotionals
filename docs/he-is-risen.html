<p><strong>1 Corinthians 15:3–4</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received:
that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures, that he
was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the
Scriptures,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The daily readings include excerpts from sermons, commentaries,
hymns, the book: <u>The Valley of Vision</u>, by The Banner of Truth
Trust, as well as thoughts, comments, and prayers by Pastor Jeff.</p>
<p>This devotional is intended to help us direct our minds towards the
great redemptive act of Jesus Christ at the cross, in His resurrection
from the grave, and His ascension.</p>
<p>The first eleven days we will read through the final days of Jesus
Christ on earth. This begins with Thursday evening in the Garden of
Gethsemane where He was betrayed, and ends when He ascends upward to
heaven. The account is from the Gospel of Matthew.</p>
<p>Each day’s devotion contains a short prayer drawn from the scripture
and/or the quote that coincides with the scripture for that day.</p>
<p>The Bible translation is from the English Standard Version. It is
possible that within some quotes, another translation may be used by the
author.</p>
<p>May the soul of the reader be encouraged by the truth on each page.
May the soul find itself captured by the beauty and power of the
greatest act of God towards man. That is, to redeem sinful man back to
Himself.</p>
<p>May Jesus Christ be honored and glorified in this work, now and
forever more. Amen.</p>

<p><strong>Jesus Prays in Gethsemane</strong></p>
<p><strong>Matthew 26</strong></p>
<p><sub>36</sub> Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane,
and he said to his disciples, “Sit here, while I go over there and
pray.” <sub>37</sub> And taking with him Peter and the two sons of
Zebedee, he began to be sorrowful and troubled. <sub>38</sub> Then he
said to them, “My soul is very sorrowful, even to death; remain here,
and watch with me.” <sub>39</sub> And going a little farther he fell on
his face and prayed, saying, “My Father, if it be possible, let this cup
pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will.”
<sub>40</sub> And he came to the disciples and found them sleeping. And
he said to Peter, “So, could you not watch with me one hour?
<sub>41</sub> Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation. The
spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.” <sub>42</sub> Again,
for the second time, he went away and prayed, “My Father, if this cannot
pass unless I drink it, your will be done.” <sub>43</sub> And again he
came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy. <sub>44</sub>
So, leaving them again, he went away and prayed for the third time,
saying the same words again. <sub>45</sub> Then he came to the disciples
and said to them, “Sleep and take your rest later on. See, the hour is
at hand, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.
<sub>46</sub> Rise, let us be going; see, my betrayer is at hand.”</p>
<h2 id="prayer">Prayer</h2>
<p><em>“Jesus, My Savior, forgive me for my neglect of prayer. I have
failed to take Your warning to heart. I have failed to believe in the
need to pray. I have failed to watch and pray. Stir my soul unto thee.
Remind me of the necessity to pray. Amen!”</em></p>
<h1 id="march-2nd">March 2<sup>nd</sup></h1>
<p><strong>Betrayal and Arrest of Jesus</strong></p>
<p><strong>Matthew 26</strong></p>
<p><sub>47 </sub>While he was still speaking, Judas came, one of the
twelve, and with him a great crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief
priests and the elders of the people. <sub>48</sub> Now the betrayer had
given them a sign, saying, “The one I will kiss is the man; seize him.”
<sub>49</sub> And he came up to Jesus at once and said, “Greetings,
Rabbi!” And he kissed him. <sub>50</sub> Jesus said to him, “Friend, do
what you came to do.” Then they came up and laid hands on Jesus and
seized him. <sub>51</sub> And behold, one of those who were with Jesus
stretched out his hand and drew his sword and struck the servant of the
high priest and cut off his ear. <sub>52 </sub>Then Jesus said to him,
“Put your sword back into its place. For all who take the sword will
perish by the sword. <sub>53 </sub>Do you think that I cannot appeal to
my Father, and he will at once send me more than twelve legions of
angels? <sub>54</sub> But how then should the Scriptures be fulfilled,
that it must be so?” <sub>55</sub> At that hour Jesus said to the
crowds, “Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs to
capture me? Day after day I sat in the temple teaching, and you did not
seize me. <sub>56</sub> But all this has taken place that the Scriptures
of the prophets might be fulfilled.” Then all the disciples left him and
fled.</p>
<h2 id="prayer-1">Prayer</h2>
<p><em>“Father God, I can relate to Judas, who betrayed the Son of Man.
I have repeated this sin over and over. Thank you for Your complete
forgiveness. I can relate to the soldiers who came to miss treat Him. I
am guilty. I know that You have forgiven me, and there is no guilt upon
me. Lead me to stand for You and for the truth of the cross. Amen
!”</em></p>
<h1 id="march-3rd">March 3<sup>rd</sup></h1>
<p><strong>Jesus Before Caiaphas and the Council</strong></p>
<p><strong>Matthew 26</strong></p>
<p><sub>57</sub> Then those who had seized Jesus led him to Caiaphas the
high priest, where the scribes and the elders had gathered.
<sub>58 </sub>And Peter was following him at a distance, as far as the
courtyard of the high priest, and going inside he sat with the guards to
see the end. <sub>59</sub> Now the chief priests and the whole council
were seeking false testimony against Jesus that they might put him to
death, <sub>60 </sub>but they found none, though many false witnesses
came forward. At last two came forward <sub>61 </sub>and said, “This man
said, ‘I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to rebuild it in
three days.’ ” <sub>62</sub> And the high priest stood up and said,
“Have you no answer to make? What is it that these men testify against
you?” <sub>63</sub> But Jesus remained silent. And the high priest said
to him, “I adjure you by the living God, tell us if you are the Christ,
the Son of God.” <sub>64</sub> Jesus said to him, “You have said so. But
I tell you, from now on you will see the Son of Man seated at the right
hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven.” <sub>65</sub> Then
the high priest tore his robes and said, “He has uttered blasphemy. What
further witnesses do we need? You have now heard his blasphemy.
<sub>66 </sub>What is your judgment?” They answered, “He deserves
death.” <sub>67</sub> Then they spit in his face and struck him. And
some slapped him, <sub>68</sub> saying, “Prophesy to us, you Christ! Who
is it that struck you?”</p>
<h2 id="prayer-2">Prayer</h2>
<p><em>“Heavenly Father, Jesus fulfilled the prophesy in Isaiah 53:7.
Like a lamb that is led to the slaughter, He opened not His mouth. He
took all of this to reconcile us to You. Hallelujah!”</em></p>
<h1 id="march-4th">March 4<sup>th</sup></h1>
<p><strong>Peter Denies Jesus</strong></p>
<p><strong>Matthew 26</strong></p>
<p><sub>69</sub> Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard. And a
servant girl came up to him and said, “You also were with Jesus the
Galilean.” <sub>70</sub> But he denied it before them all, saying, “I do
not know what you mean.” <sub>71</sub> And when he went out to the
entrance, another servant girl saw him, and she said to the bystanders,
“This man was with Jesus of Nazareth.” <sub>72</sub> And again he denied
it with an oath: “I do not know the man.” <sub>73</sub> After a little
while the bystanders came up and said to Peter, “Certainly you too are
one of them, for your accent betrays you.” <sub>74</sub> Then he began
to invoke a curse on himself and to swear, “I do not know the man.” And
immediately the rooster crowed. <sub>75 </sub>And Peter remembered the
saying of Jesus, “Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three
times.” And he went out and wept bitterly.</p>
<p><strong>Jesus Delivered to Pilate</strong></p>
<p><strong>Matthew 27</strong></p>
<p><sub>1</sub> When morning came, all the chief priests and the elders
of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death.
<sub>2 </sub>And they bound him and led him away and delivered him over
to Pilate the governor.</p>
<h2 id="prayer-3">Prayer</h2>
<p><em>“Heavenly Father, thank You for Jesus’ once forever sacrifice.
This includes all the times that I denied Him in my words, actions, and
when I failed to obey Him as I ought. Such love and forgiveness make me
seek and love Him more and more. In my weaknesses, I can always run to
You. Amen.”</em></p>
<h1 id="march-5th">March 5<sup>th</sup></h1>
<p><strong>Judas Hangs Himself</strong></p>
<p><strong>Matthew 27</strong></p>
<p><sub>3 </sub>Then when Judas, his betrayer, saw that Jesus was
condemned, he changed his mind and brought back the thirty pieces of
silver to the chief priests and the elders, <sub>4</sub> saying, “I have
sinned by betraying innocent blood.” They said, “What is that to us? See
to it yourself.” <sub>5 </sub>And throwing down the pieces of silver
into the temple, he departed, and he went and hanged himself.
<sub>6</sub> But the chief priests, taking the pieces of silver, said,
“It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it is blood
money.” <sub>7</sub> So they took counsel and bought with them the
potter’s field as a burial place for strangers. <sub>8</sub> Therefore
that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day.
<sub>9</sub> Then was fulfilled what had been spoken by the prophet
Jeremiah, saying, “And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price
of him on whom a price had been set by some of the sons of Israel,
<sub>10</sub> and they gave them for the potter’s field, as the Lord
directed me.”</p>
<h2 id="prayer-4">Prayer</h2>
<p><em>“Oh God, how dreadful is Judas’ ending. And also the actions of
the chief priests who were full of hate and jealousy towards Christ
Jesus. I know that this was Your eternal plan before the foundations of
the world. And these men fulfilled their own lusts while fulfilling Your
predetermined plan. Though man thought he was in control, You were
carrying out the great redemptive plan, as promised all the way back in
Genesis 3. I am always amazed at Your providence and provision for
eternal life for those You love. Great is our God! Amen.”</em></p>
<h1 id="march-6th">March 6<sup>th</sup></h1>
<p><strong>Jesus Before Pilate</strong></p>
<p><strong>Matthew 27</strong></p>
<p><sub>11</sub> Now Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor
asked him, “Are you the King of the Jews?” Jesus said, “You have said
so.” <sub>12</sub> But when he was accused by the chief priests and
elders, he gave no answer. <sub>13 </sub>Then Pilate said to him, “Do
you not hear how many things they testify against you?”
<sub>14</sub> But he gave him no answer, not even to a single charge, so
that the governor was greatly amazed.</p>
<p><strong>The Crowd Chooses Barabbas</strong></p>
<p><sub>15</sub> Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to release
for the crowd any one prisoner whom they wanted. <sub>16 </sub>And they
had then a notorious prisoner called Barabbas. <sub>17</sub> So when
they had gathered, Pilate said to them, “Whom do you want me to release
for you: Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?” <sub>18</sub> For he
knew that it was out of envy that they had delivered him up.
<sub>19</sub> Besides, while he was sitting on the judgment seat, his
wife sent word to him, “Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for
I have suffered much because of him today in a dream.” <sub>20</sub> Now
the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas
and destroy Jesus. <sub>21</sub> The governor again said to them, “Which
of the two do you want me to release for you?” And they said,
“Barabbas.” <sub>22</sub> Pilate said to them, “Then what shall I do
with Jesus who is called Christ?” They all said, “Let him be crucified!”
<sub>23</sub> And he said, “Why? What evil has he done?” But they
shouted all the more, “Let him be crucified!”</p>
<h1 id="march-7th">March 7<sup>th</sup></h1>
<p><strong>Pilate Delivers Jesus to Be Crucified</strong></p>
<p><strong>Matthew 27</strong></p>
<p><sub>24</sub> So when Pilate saw that he was gaining nothing, but
rather that a riot was beginning, he took water and washed his hands
before the crowd, saying, “I am innocent of this man’s blood; see to it
yourselves.” <sub>25</sub> And all the people answered, “His blood be on
us and on our children!” <sub>26</sub> Then he released for them
Barabbas, and having scourged Jesus, delivered him to be crucified.</p>
<p><strong>Jesus Is Mocked</strong></p>
<p><sub>27</sub> Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the
governor’s headquarters, and they gathered the whole battalion before
him. <sub>28</sub> And they stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him,
<sub>29</sub> and twisting together a crown of thorns, they put it on
his head and put a reed in his right hand. And kneeling before him, they
mocked him, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!” <sub>30</sub> And they
spit on him and took the reed and struck him on the head.
<sub>31</sub> And when they had mocked him, they stripped him of the
robe and put his own clothes on him and led him away to crucify him.</p>
<h2 id="prayer-5">Prayer</h2>
<p><em>“Heavenly Father, when I read and see this treatment of my
Savior, my heart is weighed down, greatly filled with sorrow. But then I
remember that this was the plan and it was being carried out exactly as
it had to be. This was what Jesus wanted. This was the unfolding plan of
redemption for us. My sorrow is turned to joy. Praise and thanksgiving
fill my mind and mouth. Thank you, Jesus, for all that you went through
for us, Your beloved ones. Amen.”</em></p>
<h1 id="march-8th">March 8<sup>th</sup></h1>
<p><strong>The Crucifixion</strong></p>
<p><strong>Matthew 27</strong></p>
<p><sub>32</sub> As they went out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by
name. They compelled this man to carry his cross. <sub>33 </sub>And when
they came to a place called Golgotha (which means Place of a Skull),
<sub>34 </sub>they offered him wine to drink, mixed with gall, but when
he tasted it, he would not drink it. <sub>35</sub> And when they had
crucified him, they divided his garments among them by casting lots.
<sub>36</sub> Then they sat down and kept watch over him there.
<sub>37 </sub>And over his head they put the charge against him, which
read, “This is Jesus, the King of the Jews.” <sub>38 </sub>Then two
robbers were crucified with him, one on the right and one on the left.
<sub>39</sub> And those who passed by derided him, wagging their heads
<sub>40</sub> and saying, “You who would destroy the temple and rebuild
it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down
from the cross.” <sub>41 </sub>So also the chief priests, with the
scribes and elders, mocked him, saying, <sub>42</sub> “He saved others;
he cannot save himself. He is the King of Israel; let him come down now
from the cross, and we will believe in him. <sub>43</sub> He trusts in
God; let God deliver him now, if he desires him. For he said, ‘I am the
Son of God.’ ” <sub>44</sub> And the robbers who were crucified with him
also reviled him in the same way.</p>
<h2 id="prayer-6">Prayer</h2>
<p><em>“Jesus Christ, Eternal Son, Savior, and King of Glory! You came
and were fixed on the eternal purpose. You endured such mockery,
ridicule, and pain yet You did not sin. Perfect and sinless, even going
through all of this; no other could, and no other would. Blessed be Your
name forever!”</em></p>
<h1 id="march-9th">March 9<sup>th</sup></h1>
<p><strong>The Death of Jesus</strong></p>
<p><strong>Matthew 27</strong></p>
<p><sub>45</sub> Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the
land until the ninth hour. <sub>46</sub> And about the ninth hour Jesus
cried out with a loud voice, saying, “Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?” that
is, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” <sub>47</sub> And some
of the bystanders, hearing it, said, “This man is calling Elijah.”
<sub>48</sub> And one of them at once ran and took a sponge, filled it
with sour wine, and put it on a reed and gave it to him to drink.
<sub>49</sub> But the others said, “Wait, let us see whether Elijah will
come to save him.” <sub>50</sub> And Jesus cried out again with a loud
voice and yielded up his spirit.</p>
<p><sub>51</sub> And behold, the curtain of the temple was torn in two,
from top to bottom. And the earth shook, and the rocks were split.
<sub>52 </sub>The tombs also were opened. And many bodies of the saints
who had fallen asleep were raised, <sub>53</sub> and coming out of the
tombs after his resurrection they went into the holy city and appeared
to many. <sub>54</sub> When the centurion and those who were with him,
keeping watch over Jesus, saw the earthquake and what took place, they
were filled with awe and said, “Truly this was the Son of God!”</p>
<p><sub>55 </sub>There were also many women there, looking on from a
distance, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to him,
<sub>56 </sub>among whom were Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of
James and Joseph and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.</p>
<h1 id="march-10th">March 10<sup>th</sup></h1>
<p><strong>Jesus Is Buried</strong></p>
<p><strong>Matthew 27</strong></p>
<p><sub>57</sub> When it was evening, there came a rich man from
Arimathea, named Joseph, who also was a disciple of Jesus.
<sub>58</sub> He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then
Pilate ordered it to be given to him. <sub>59</sub> And Joseph took the
body and wrapped it in a clean linen shroud <sub>60 </sub>and laid it in
his own new tomb, which he had cut in the rock. And he rolled a great
stone to the entrance of the tomb and went away. <sub>61</sub> Mary
Magdalene and the other Mary were there, sitting opposite the tomb.</p>
<p><strong>The Guard at the Tomb</strong></p>
<p><sub>62</sub> The next day, that is, after the day of Preparation,
the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered before Pilate
<sub>63</sub> and said, “Sir, we remember how that impostor said, while
he was still alive, ‘After three days I will rise.’
<sub>64</sub> Therefore order the tomb to be made secure until the third
day, lest his disciples go and steal him away and tell the people, ‘He
has risen from the dead,’ and the last fraud will be worse than the
first.” <sub>65</sub> Pilate said to them, “You have a guard of
soldiers. Go, make it as secure as you can.” <sub>66 </sub>So they went
and made the tomb secure by sealing the stone and setting a guard.</p>
<h2 id="prayer-7">Prayer</h2>
<p><em>“Hallelujah, YOU ARE the living Savior. You were dead and yet You
live! Hallelujah! Victory is Yours! No one and nothing could hold You in
the grave. The devil could not stop You on the cross, nor could he keep
You in the grave. A stone to hold You; to stop the God who made the
stone? You are God, my God!”</em></p>
<h1 id="march-11th">March 11<sup>th</sup></h1>
<p><strong>The Resurrection</strong></p>
<p><strong>Matthew 28</strong></p>
<p><sub>1</sub> Now after the Sabbath, toward the dawn of the first day
of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb.
<sub>2</sub> And behold, there was a great earthquake, for an angel of
the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone and
sat on it. <sub>3</sub> His appearance was like lightning, and his
clothing white as snow. <sub>4</sub> And for fear of him the guards
trembled and became like dead men. <sub>5</sub> But the angel said to
the women, “Do not be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus who was
crucified. <sub>6</sub> He is not here, for he has risen, as he said.
Come, see the place where he lay. <sub>7 </sub>Then go quickly and tell
his disciples that he has risen from the dead, and behold, he is going
before you to Galilee; there you will see him. See, I have told you.”
<sub>8</sub> So they departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great
joy, and ran to tell his disciples. <sub>9 </sub>And behold, Jesus met
them and said, “Greetings!” And they came up and took hold of his feet
and worshiped him. <sub>10</sub> Then Jesus said to them, “Do not be
afraid; go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee, and there they will
see me.”</p>
<h2 id="prayer-8">Prayer</h2>
<p><em>“Heavenly Father, forever I will offer thanksgiving for revealing
to me the resurrected Savior. Help me not to take that gracious act of
revelation for granted. You have opened the eyes of my heart and I see
Him. And He has drawn me to Himself to know Him, and to know what He has
done for me. Praise and thanksgiving to You forevermore. Amen!”</em></p>
<h1 id="march-12th">March 12<sup>th</sup></h1>
<p><strong>The Report of the Guard</strong></p>
<p><strong>Matthew 28</strong></p>
<p><sub>11 </sub>While they were going, behold, some of the guard went
into the city and told the chief priests all that had taken place.
<sub>12</sub> And when they had assembled with the elders and taken
counsel, they gave a sufficient sum of money to the soldiers
<sub>13 </sub>and said, “Tell people, ‘His disciples came by night and
stole him away while we were asleep.’ <sub>14</sub> And if this comes to
the governor’s ears, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble.”
<sub>15</sub> So they took the money and did as they were directed. And
this story has been spread among the Jews to this day.</p>
<p><strong>The Great Commission</strong></p>
<p><sub>16</sub> Now the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the
mountain to which Jesus had directed them. <sub>17</sub> And when they
saw him they worshiped him, but some doubted. <sub>18</sub> And Jesus

<p><em><strong>John 19:25–27</strong> — but standing by the cross of
Jesus were his mother and his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas,
and Mary Magdalene. <sub>26</sub> When Jesus saw his mother and the
disciple whom he loved standing nearby, he said to his mother, “Woman,
behold, your son!” <sub>27</sub> Then he said to the disciple, “Behold,
your mother!” And from that hour the disciple took her to his own
home.</em></p>
<p>When I read the verses above, I must stop, as if held in the same
bewilderment as those mentioned. I can see these women with the disciple
John on that hill. I can see them standing, gazing, almost in unbelief
that this is happening. I can imagine that the smallest details of those
hours were engraved in their memories. The sights, yes, but also the
sounds—every sound, and the smells, and the wind blowing in their faces.
The hate-filled scoffing from the religious rulers piercing their
hearts. Perhaps the callousness of the Roman soldiers in the treatment
of their victims stirred anger or more heartbreak. Could any of those
impressions ever diminish in their minds? All of it must have played
over and over a million times that night as they tried in vain to sleep.
But when they met the risen Savior, the memories of every detail of that
day, which had been wrapped in death, agonizing pain, and sorrow were
reborn with joy inexpressible. The memories remained, but they were
changed. Hopelessness to hope; death to life; sorrow to joy; fear to
faith. He is alive! [Pastor Jeff Beard]</p>

<p>“The apostles were on trial, having been arrested for preaching the

did they speak as they did? Their lives were in jeopardy because their
adversaries had authority—they were the great Sanhedrin, the highest

connected to the Roman governor. And here were these simple
apostles—fishermen, artisans, ‘unlearned and ignorant men’ (Acts

<p>“The apostles said, ‘We are his witnesses to these things.’ Moreover,
they were filled with a new life, with a new courage. Their lives had
been revolutionized. They were entirely different people, filled with a
joy and a happiness and peace that nothing could remove from them. They

<p>On the Day of Pentecost, shortly after Jesus had ascended to heaven,
Peter stood up before thousands and preached the Gospel of Salvation. To
those listening he proclaimed, “you crucified and killed” this Jesus.
You and I were not physically in the crowd shouting, “Crucify him,
Crucify him.” We did not order his scrouging and death. Our hands did
not physically draw the hammer down on the nails and lifted the cross
with him nailed to it, but our hearts did.</p>
<p>Peter is preaching this same sermon to us today. Jesus came because
we were guilty of sin and our long list of wickedness includes the
murder of Jesus Christ on the cross. When a person’s heart is turned
away from Jesus and refuses to obey Him, he is guilty. When we want him
away from us, to leave us alone, we have crucified Him in our hearts.
Thankfully, the Spirit of God turned our hearts towards Jesus and we
found full and complete forgiveness. Our wicked hearts nailed him there,
and our wicked hearts were the reason He came from heaven to be nailed
there. Our wicked hearts have been cleansed by the One we once hated.
What a miracle worked into our hearts! [Pastor Jeff Beard]</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Skeptics may ask, “Why should our forgiveness depend on Christ’s
death? Why does God not simply forgive us, without the necessity of the
cross?”</p>
<p>John Stott gives two answers. “The first was supplied by Archbishop
Anselm at the end of the eleventh century. If anybody imagines, he
wrote, that God can simply forgive us as we forgive others, that person
has ‘not yet considered the seriousness of sin,’ or literally ‘what a
heavy weight sin is.’ The second answer might be expressed similarly:
‘You have not yet considered the majesty of God.’ It is when our
perception of God and man, or of holiness and sin, are askew then our
understanding of the atonement is bound to be askew also.”</p>
<p>Stott continues, “The crucial question we should ask, therefore, is a
different one. It is not why God finds it difficult to forgive, but how
he finds it possible to do so at all. As Emil Brunner put it,
‘Forgiveness is the very opposite of anything which can be taken for
granted. Nothing is less obvious than forgiveness.’ Or, in the words of
Carnegie Simpson, ‘forgiveness is to man the plainest of duties; to God
it is the profoundest of problems.’ [John R. W. Stott (1921-2011)]</p>

<p>“Death by crucifixion was one of the worst forms of dying. No Roman
citizen was ever crucified; this horrible death was reserved only for
Rome’s enemies. The Roman scourge was a most dreadful instrument of
torture and suffering. It was made of sinews of oxen, and sharp bones
were inter-twisted among the sinews so that every time the lash came
down upon a body, these pieces of bone inflicted fearful lacerations and
literally tore off chunks of flesh from the person’s bones. This is what
Christ endured in accomplishing our redemption. But the physical
suffering was not the worst. Rather, the weight of human sin and the
separation from God the Father because of His wrath against sin were the
real causes of the Savior’s death.</p>
<p>“But simply knowing about Christ’s suffering and death is not enough.
We must personally appropriate this to our own lives. We must say, ‘It
was for me!’ We must allow the Holy Spirit to do in us subjectively all
that Christ has done for us objectively. Then, after we have experienced
this redemptive work in our own lives, we must humbly, lovingly, and
thoughtfully ‘follow in His steps’ and seek to restore others. [Kenneth

<p>Show me the enormity of my guilt by the crown of thorns, the pierced
hands and feet, the bruised body, the dying cries.</p>

<p>Yet thy compassions yearn over me, thy heart hastens to my rescue,

<p><em><strong>Galatians 2:20</strong> — I have been crucified with
Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me. And the
life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who
loved me and gave himself for me.</em></p>
<p>“For the same New Testament that contains Paul’s flash of
individualism ‘I have been crucified with Christ…. I live by faith in
the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me’ (Gal 2:20), also
insists that Jesus Christ ‘gave himself for us to redeem us from all
wickedness and to purify for himself a people that are his very own,
eager to do what is good’ (Tit 2:14; Acts 2:40–41). Thus, the very
purpose of his self-giving on the cross was not just to save isolated
individuals, and so perpetuate their loneliness, but to create a new
community whose members would belong to him, love one another, and
eagerly serve the world.</p>
<p>This community of Christ would be nothing less than a renewed and
reunited humanity, of which he, as the second Adam, would be head. It
would incorporate Jews and Gentiles on equal terms. In fact, it would
include representatives from every nation. Christ died in abject
aloneness, rejected by his own nation, and deserted by his own
disciples, but lifted up on the cross he would draw all people to
himself. And from the Day of Pentecost onward it has been clear that
conversion to Christ means also conversion to the community of Christ,
as people turn from themselves to him, and from ‘this corrupt
generation’ to the alternative society which he is gathering around
himself.” [John R. W. Stott (1921-2011)]</p>

<p>This was the belief that turned heartbroken followers of a crucified
rabbi into the courageous witnesses and martyrs of the early church.
This was the one belief that separated the followers of Jesus from the
Jews and turned them into the community of the resurrection. You could
imprison them, flog them, kill them, but you could not make them deny
their conviction that ‘on the third day he rose again.’ The resurrection
of Jesus Christ from the dead is the cornerstone of Christianity. Every

crucifixion of Jesus Christ entails more than the physical pain and
death on a Roman cross. It was the place where the Son of God took the
wrath of God upon Himself. It is where He took upon Himself your wrath,
my wrath, the wrath of all who were to come to Him. The full cup of
judgement was poured upon Jesus Christ. That is what it costs to bring

<p>“These verses show us what glory the crucifixion brought both to God

though He said, ‘The time of my crucifixion is at hand. My work on earth
is finished. An event is about to take place to-morrow, which, however
painful to you who love Me, is in reality most glorifying both to Me and
My Father.’</p>
<p>The crucifixion brought glory to the Father. It glorified His wisdom,
faithfulness, holiness, and love. It showed Him wise, in providing a
plan whereby He could be just, and yet the Justifier of the ungodly.—It
showed Him faithful, in keeping His promise, that the seed of the woman
should bruise the serpent’s head.—It showed Him holy, in requiring His
law’s demands to be satisfied by our great Substitute.—It showed Him

compassion, His patience, and His power. It showed Him most
compassionate, in dying for us, suffering in our stead, allowing Himself
to be counted sin and a curse for us, and buying our redemption with the
price of His own blood.—It showed Him most patient, in not dying the
common death of most men, but in willingly submitting to such horrors
and unknown agonies as no mind can conceive, when with a word he could
have summoned His Father’s angels, and been set free.—It showed Him most
powerful, in bearing the weight of all a world’s transgressions, and
vanquishing Satan and despoiling him of his prey.</p>
<p>For ever let us cling to these thoughts about the crucifixion. Let us
remember that painting and sculpture can never tell a tenth part of what
took place on the cross. Crucifixes and pictures at best can only show
us a human being agonizing in a painful death. But of the length and
breadth and depth and height of the work transacted on the cross,—of
God’s law honored, man’s sins borne, sin punished in a Substitute, free
salvation bought for man,—of all this they can tell nothing. Yet all
this lies hid under the crucifixion. No wonder St. Paul cries, “God
forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.”

told the disciples details of the future regarding what would happen to
Him in Jerusalem. His foretelling was in detail and in chronological
order. The disciples believed His words. They had come to know that
whatever the Master said was true and is truth. They so much believed
what the Master said would come to pass that they were “greatly
distressed” (Matt. 17:23) to hear what was to come of Him.</p>

mocking, the physical torture, and then death on a cross, but that would

or in the quiet resting places; not in the garden of nuts, or in the
beds of spices; not in the tents of Kedar, or between Solomon’s
curtains; not even at his sacramental table, nor yet amongst the means
of grace, is Christ bodily, actually, present. So we will take the
sweetness of all, and the spiritual good there may be in all outward
means; but still they shall all point us upward; they shall all draw us
away. As the sun exhales the dew, and attracts it upward towards heaven,
so shall Christ magnetize and draw our hearts away, and our thoughts up,
and our longings up, and our whole spirits up, towards himself!”He is
not here.” Then why should I be here?”</p>

<p><em><strong>Acts 2:22–24</strong> — Men of Israel, hear these words:
Jesus of Nazareth, a man attested to you by God with mighty works and
wonders and signs that God did through him in your midst, as you
yourselves know— <sub>23</sub> this Jesus, delivered up according to the
definite plan and foreknowledge of God, you crucified and killed by the
hands of lawless men. <sub>24</sub> God raised him up, loosing the pangs
of death, because it was not possible for him to be held by it.</em></p>
<p>“Why did the apostles stress the resurrection in particular? First of
all, it is the resurrection that finally proves who our Lord is. It is
the resurrection that finally establishes the point that this Jesus whom
the Jewish leaders had despised—Jesus the carpenter, this fellow, this
man who had learning, never having learned, this imposter, this
blasphemer, this one who claimed equality with God—really was all He
claimed to be. It is the final proof that He is none other than God’s
only begotten Son, the eternal Son of God; that though He was a man, He
was not only a man.</p>
<p>“Ah,” you say, “but what about the case of Lazarus? Didn’t he also
rise from the dead?” Lazarus was merely restored to life, and he died
again later on. Our Lord, by contrast, is “the first begotten of [from]
the dead” (Rev. 1:5). He is the first person ever to have gone through
death and come out the other side alive. And that is the proof of the
fact that He is the Son of God. [Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones (1899-1981)]</p>

<p>The above is from Jesus’ prayer to the Father. Below is from a sermon
by the Puritan Pastor, Thomas Manton.</p>
<p>“Observe again, that none are given to Christ but those that were
first the Father’s: ‘Thine they were;’ he had chosen them in the
purposes of his grace, and disposed them into Christ’s hands. The acts
of the three persons are commensurable, of the same sphere and latitude;
those whom the Father chooseth, the Son redeemeth, and the Spirit
sanctifieth. The Father loveth none but those that are given to Christ,
and Christ taketh charge of none but those that are loved of the Father.
Your election will be known by your interest in Christ, and your
interest in Christ by the sanctification of the Spirit. All God’s flock
are put into Christ’s hands, and Christ leaveth them to the care of the
Spirit, that they may be enlightened and sanctified. In looking after
the comfort of election, you must first look inward to the work of the
Spirit on your hearts, then outward to the work of Christ on the cross,
then upward to the heart of the Father in heaven: 1 Peter 1:2, ’Elect
according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification
of the Spirit, unto obedience, and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus
Christ. There is a chain of salvation; the beginning is from the Father,
the dispensation through the Son, the application by the Spirit; all
cometh from God, and is conveyed to us through Christ, by the Spirit.”

<p><em><strong>Luke 23:34</strong> — And Jesus said, “Father, forgive
them, for they know not what they do.”</em></p>
<p>“Father, forgive them.” On no previous occasion did Christ make such
a request of the Father. Never before had he invoked the Father’s
forgiveness of others. Hitherto he forgave himself. To the man sick of
the palsy he had said, “Son, be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven
thee” (Matthew 9:2). To the woman who washed his feet with her tears in
the house of Simon, he said, “Thy sins are forgiven” (Luke 7:48). Why
then should he now ask the Father to forgive, instead of directly
pronouncing forgiveness himself?</p>
<p>Forgiveness of sin is a divine prerogative. The Jewish scribes were
right when they reasoned “Who can forgive sins but God only?” (Mark
2:7). But you say, Christ was God. Truly; but man also—the God-man. He
was the Son of God that had become the Son of Man with the express
purpose of offering himself as a sacrifice for sin. And when the Lord
Jesus cried “Father, forgive them” he was on the cross, and there he
might not exercise his divine prerogatives. Moreover, on the cross he
was acting as our substitute; the just was about to die for the unjust.
Thus we say that when the blessed Lord Jesus cried, “Father, forgive
them,” we see him absolutely identified with his people. No longer was
he in the position where he had the “power” or “right” to forgive sins;
instead, he intercedes for sinners—as we must.” [A.W. Pink
(1886-1952)]</p>
<h2 id="prayer-28">Prayer</h2>

“Behold, your mother!” And from that hour the disciple took her to his
own home.</em></p>
<p>“The Lord Jesus was dying as the Savior for sinners. He was engaged
in the most momentous and the most stupendous undertaking that this
earth ever has or ever will witness. He was on the point of offering
satisfaction to the outraged justice of God. He was just about to do
that work for which the world had been made, for which the human race
had been created, for which all the ages had waited, and for which he,
the eternal Word, had become incarnate. Nevertheless, he does not
overlook the responsibilities of natural ties; he fails not to make
provision for her who, according to the flesh, was his mother.</p>
<p>There is a lesson here which many need to take to heart in these
days. No duty, no work, however important it may be, can excuse us from
discharging the obligations of nature, from caring for those who have
fleshly claims upon us.” [A.W. Pink (1886-1952)]</p>

<p><em><strong>Luke 22:44</strong> — And being in agony he prayed more

<p>“Hence we may learn how dreadful Christ’s last sufferings were. We
learn it from the dreadful effect which the bare foresight of them had
upon him in his agony. His last sufferings were so dreadful, that the
view which Christ had of them before overwhelmed him and amazed him, as
it is said he began to be sore amazed. The very sight of these last
sufferings was so very dreadful as to sink his soul down into the dark
shadow of death; yea, so dreadful was it, that in the sore conflict
which his nature had with it, he was all in a sweat of blood, his body
all over was covered with clotted blood, and not only his body, but the
very ground under him with the blood that fell from him, which had been
forced through his pores through the violence of his agony. And if only
the foresight of the cup was so dreadful, how dreadful was the cup
itself, how far beyond all that can be uttered or conceived! And what
has been said affords a convincing argument that the sufferings which
Christ endured in his body on the cross, though they were very dreadful,
were yet the least part of his last sufferings; and that beside those,
he endured sufferings in his soul which were vastly greater. For if it
had been only the sufferings which he endured in his body, though they
were very dreadful, we cannot conceive that the mere anticipation of
them would have such an effect on Christ. From what has been said, we
may see the wonderful strength of the love of Christ to sinners.”

<p>“The death of Christ on the cross, it was a bitter death, a sorrowful
death, a bloody death. The bitter thoughts of his sufferings put him
into a most dreadful agony: Luke 22:44, ‘Being in an agony, he prayed
more earnestly, and his sweat was as great drops of blood falling to the
ground.’ The Greek word that is here used, Ἀγωνία, signifies a striving
or wrestling against, as two combatants or wrestlers do strive each
against other. The things which our Savior strove against was not only
the terror of death, as other men are wont to do—for then many
Christians and martyrs might have seemed more constant and courageous
than he—but with the terrible justice of God, pouring out his high anger
and indignation upon him on the account of all the sins of his chosen
that were laid upon him, than which nothing could be more dreadful, Isa.
53:4–6. Christ was in a vehement conflict in his soul, through the
deepest sense of his Father’s wrath against sinners, for whom he now
stood as a surety and Redeemer. And for a close of this particular, let
me say that God’s justice which we have provoked, being fully satisfied
by the inestimable merit of Christ’s passion, is the surest and highest

<p>The crosses were only a few feet apart and it did not take the Savior
long to hear this cry of the penitent thief. What was his response
thereto? He might have said, You deserve your fate: you are a wicked
robber and have merited death. Or, he might have replied, You have left
it till too late; you should have sought me sooner. Ah! but had he not
promised, “Him that cometh to me! will in no wise cast out!” So it
proved here.</p>
<p>The salvation of the repentant and believing robber illustrates not
only Christ’s readiness but also his power to save sinners. The Lord
Jesus is no feeble Savior. Blessed be God he is able to “save unto the
uttermost” them that come unto God by him. And never was this so
signally displayed as when on the cross. This was the time of the
Redeemer’s “weakness” (2 Cor. 13:4). When the thief cried, “Lord,
remember me,” the Savior was in agony on the accursed tree. Yet even
then, even there, he had power to redeem this soul from death and open
for him the gates of Paradise! Never doubt then, or question the
infinite sufficiency of the Savior. [A.W. Pink (1886-1952)]</p>
